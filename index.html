<p>Card Sleeves for Humanity makes the black cards with pick 2's and pick 3's much easier to play with!</p>

<p>Nearly every time I have played Cards Against Humanity and the like, people skip the black cards that have either pick 2 or pick 3. People skip over them because they are hard to manage. If you have 6 people submitting cards, it is hard to shuffle the cards while keeping them in the intended order.</p>

<p>No more skipping these troublesome black cards!</p>

<p>Card Sleeves for Humanity fixes these issues!
The black cards that require 2 or more white cards can now easily be submitted in the correct order and shuffled so the anonymity of the submission is upheld.</p>

<p>These are sold in sets of 6.</p>

<p>This product works great with <a href="https://cardsagainsthumanity.com">Cards Against Humanity</a> or any other game like it that uses standard size cards.</p>
